# Code for the paper "Machine learning for zombie hunting"

In this repository we provide the code for the data analysis part of the paper _"Machine learning for zombie hunting. Firms' failures, financial constraints, and misallocation"_ by F.J. Bargagli-Stoffi, M. Riccaboni and A. Rungi.

The code is written both in Stata and R. The data cleaning and the creation of the indicators were performed in Stata. R was used for the machine learning analysis.

Below a brief legend of the Stata files.
